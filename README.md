# saathitestapp
saathitestapp with some api code
1. put all Dart file in lib folder and replace pubspec.yaml with the original one
2. run 'flutter pub get' in terminal, run the app through android or windows
3. I have added a AWS API calling action for 'Create Goal' button with API Gateway and.      lambda, New record would insert to AWS dynamodb, but no response will give back, you.      would only know the api is called successfully with states Code 200 get.
